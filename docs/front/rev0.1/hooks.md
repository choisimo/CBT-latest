# Custom React Hooks Documentation

A thorough search was conducted within the `CBT-front/src/` directory for custom React hooks. This included:

1.  Listing directory contents to identify potential `hooks` directories or hook-related filenames.
2.  Searching for exported function declarations starting with `use` (e.g., `export function useMyHook(...){}`).
3.  Searching for exported arrow function declarations starting with `use` (e.g., `export const useMyHook = (...) => {}`).

No custom React hooks were identified based on these searches. Standard React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useMemo`) are utilized within the components, but no project-specific reusable custom hooks were found.
