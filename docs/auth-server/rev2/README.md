# Auth-Server Backend Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Auth-Server backend. This document provides an overview of the backend system, its architecture, and the structure of this documentation.

## High-Level Overview

The Auth-Server project is a comprehensive backend solution designed to handle user authentication, authorization, and related functionalities. It serves as the core for managing users, their settings, and diaries, while also providing robust security features and real-time event notifications.

**Main Features:**

*   **User Registration and Login:** Secure mechanisms for new user sign-up and existing user sign-in.
*   **JWT-based Authentication and Authorization:** Token-based security for accessing protected resources.
*   **OAuth2 Integration:** Support for third-party authentication providers.
*   **Dynamic Filter Management:** Flexible system for managing request/response filters (details in specific security documents).
*   **SSE for Real-time Events:** Server-Sent Events for pushing real-time updates to clients.
*   **Diary and Settings Management:** Features for users to manage their personal diaries and application settings.
*   **Kafka Integration:** Asynchronous event processing using Kafka for improved scalability and resilience.

**Architecture:**

The backend follows a modular design, primarily consisting of:

*   `backend`: The main application module containing core business logic, controllers, and JPA entities.
*   `common-domain`: A shared module for Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and common exception classes.
*   `kafka-module`: Handles Kafka-specific configurations and message processing.

This modular approach promotes separation of concerns and maintainability.
